        <li><strong>Systems of Equations:</strong> Learn substitution and elimination methods</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic Equations:</strong> Understand factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula</li>
        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Grasp function notation and transformations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>
      <p>Many students make these common mistakes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Forgetting to distribute negative signs</li>
        <li>Making arithmetic errors when solving equations</li>
        <li>Not checking their answers by plugging them back into the original equation</li>
        <li>Confusing similar-looking problems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Proven Strategies</h3>
      <p>Here are some effective strategies for algebra problems:</p>
      <ol>

    description: "Discover proven active reading techniques that will help you understand and retain information better on the SAT Reading section.",
    content: `
      <h2>What is Active Reading?</h2>
      <p>Active reading is a technique that involves engaging with the text as you read, rather than passively absorbing information. This approach is particularly valuable for the SAT Reading section, where you need to quickly understand and analyze complex passages.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Active Reading Strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preview the Text:</strong> Read the title, headings, and first/last sentences of paragraphs</li>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Formulate questions about what you expect to learn</li>
        <li><strong>Make Predictions:</strong> Guess what will happen next based on context clues</li>
        <li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Create mental images of what you're reading</li>
        <li><strong>Summarize:</strong> Restate main ideas in your own words</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Annotation Techniques</h3>
      <p>Effective annotation can significantly improve your comprehension:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underline key ideas:</strong> Mark main points and supporting details</li>
        <li><strong>Circle important words:</strong> Highlight vocabulary and key terms</li>
        <li><strong>Write margin notes:</strong> Jot down questions, connections, or summaries</li>
        <li><strong>Use symbols:</strong> Create a system of symbols for different types of information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Question Types and Strategies</h3>
      <p>Different question types require different approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Look for the central theme that connects all paragraphs</li>
        <li><strong>Detail Questions:</strong> Scan for specific information mentioned in the question</li>
        <li><strong>Inference Questions:</strong> Use context clues and logical reasoning</li>
        <li><strong>Vocabulary in Context:</strong> Use surrounding sentences to determine meaning</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Time Management Tips</h3>
      <p>With limited time, efficiency is crucial:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend 2-3 minutes previewing the passage</li>
        <li>Read actively, annotating as you go</li>
        <li>Answer questions in order, referring back to the text</li>
        <li>Use process of elimination for difficult questions</li>
        <li>Don't spend too much time on any single question</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Practice Exercise</h3>
      <p>Try this exercise with any reading passage:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read the title and predict what the passage will be about</li>
        <li>Skim the first and last sentences of each paragraph</li>
        <li>Read the passage actively, underlining key points</li>
        <li>Write a one-sentence summary of each paragraph</li>
        <li>Create a brief outline of the main ideas</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Active reading is a skill that improves with practice. The more you engage with texts actively, the better you'll become at understanding and analyzing complex passages. Remember, the goal is not just to read, but to comprehend and retain information effectively.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fragment:</strong> Because I was tired. (incomplete thought)</li>
        <li><strong>Run-on:</strong> I was tired I went to bed. (missing punctuation)</li>
        <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Because I was tired, I went to bed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>7. Modifier Placement</h3>
      <p>Place modifiers close to the words they modify to avoid confusion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Misplaced:</strong> I found a book in the library that was interesting.</li>
        <li><strong>Correct:</strong> I found an interesting book in the library.</li>
